# Christmas Tree
A small website built for a workshop with the Manchester Girl Geeks, run at Fablab Altrincham

The website was temporarily live, with the link distributed to participants signed up for the workshop. They were able to layout circles on a christmas tree, when they hit save an svg of their design is sent and stored on the server. Those SVGs were then sent to me before the workshop. A python script I ran locally on my laptop then collated all the svgs which could be lasercut. This meant that each participant had their own custom tree for the workshop.
